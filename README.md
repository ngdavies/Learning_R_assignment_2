### Learning R programming assignment 2

This assignment is to fulfill the requirements defined [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/peer/tNy8H/programming-assignment-2-lexical-scoping).

It is part of the [Learning R](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/home/welcome) module in the [Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) specialisation from [Johns Hopkins](https://www.coursera.org/jhu)

The purpose of this assignment is to create a pair of functions that cache data and the result of a costly computation on that data so the results can be resused without repeating the calclation.

The functions that make up the assignment are

   makeCacheMatrix
	 cacheSolve

Both functions are in the file cachematrix.R, also to be found in this repository.
